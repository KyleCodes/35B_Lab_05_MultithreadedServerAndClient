# 35B_Lab_05_MultithreadedServerAndClient
In iteration 5, Multithreaded Networking functionality is added. Within the server package is the Server object, which establishes a serverSocket on a port and waits until a client requests a connection. When the server accepts this request, it handles the connection in a new thread and continues to listen for new connection requests. Additionally, there is a client package that contains the AutoClient object, which connects to the server. From the client's end, the user can upload new models to the server, and also request an automobile object to configure on their end.
